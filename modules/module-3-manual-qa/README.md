# Module 3: Prompt Engineering for Manual QA

Welcome to Module 3! This module is specifically designed for Manual QA professionals, teaching you how to use AI to accelerate test case generation and improve testing quality.

## Module Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- How to generate comprehensive test cases using AI
- Test case generation techniques for different scenarios
- Domain-specific test case patterns
- How to combine AI-generated test cases with manual review
- Optimizing test case outputs in various formats

## Lessons

1. [Test Case Generation with AI](./01-test-case-generation.md)
   - The test case generation framework
   - Basic and advanced test case generation techniques
   - Persona-based, journey-based, and risk-based testing
   - Domain-specific test cases (Web, Mobile, API)
   - Test case categories and formats
   - Real-world examples and exercises
