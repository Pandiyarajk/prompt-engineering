├── test-generation/
│   ├── unit-tests.md
│   ├── integration-tests.md
│   └── e2e-tests.md
├── code-review/
│   ├── security-review.md
│   ├── performance-review.md
│   └── quality-review.md
├── bug-analysis/
│   ├── triage.md
│   ├── root-cause.md
│   └── fix-suggestions.md
└── documentation/
    ├── api-docs.md
    ├── test-plans.md
    └── user-guides.md
```

### 4. Learn from Failures

**Failure is Learning**

When prompts don't work:

1. **Analyze**: Why didn't it work?
2. **Document**: Record the failure
3. **Refine**: Improve the prompt
4. **Test**: Try again
5. **Share**: Help others avoid same issue

**Failure Log Template:**

```
Date: [Date]
Prompt: [What you tried]
Expected: [What you wanted]
Actual: [What you got]
Issue: [What went wrong]
Fix: [How you fixed it]
Learnings: [What you learned]
```
