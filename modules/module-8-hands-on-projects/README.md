# Module 8: Hands-on Projects

Welcome to Module 8! This module provides hands-on projects that will help you apply all the prompt engineering techniques you've learned throughout the course.

## Module Overview

In this module, you will work on four comprehensive projects that combine multiple prompt engineering techniques:

1. **Automated Test Suite Generation**: Generate complete test suites using AI
2. **Bug Triage Assistant**: Create an AI-powered bug triage system
3. **Code Review Bot**: Build an automated code review assistant
4. **Test Data Generator**: Develop an intelligent test data generation system

## Projects

1. [Project 1: Automated Test Suite Generation](./project-1-automated-test-suite-generation.md)
   - Generate comprehensive test suites
   - Apply chain-of-thought and few-shot learning
   - Create maintainable test code
   - Integrate with testing frameworks

2. [Project 2: Bug Triage Assistant](./project-2-bug-triage-assistant.md)
   - Classify and prioritize bugs automatically
   - Use role-based prompting
   - Generate bug reports
   - Create triage workflows

3. [Project 3: Code Review Bot](./project-3-code-review-bot.md)
   - Automated code review generation
   - Security and quality checks
   - Best practices enforcement
   - Review comment generation

4. [Project 4: Test Data Generator](./project-4-test-data-generator.md)
   - Generate realistic test data
   - Handle edge cases
   - Create data variations
   - Support multiple data types
