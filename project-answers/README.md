# Project Answers

This folder contains reference implementations and answers for the course projects.

## Available Projects

- [Project 1: Automated Test Suite Generator](./project-1-test-suite-generator/)
- [Project 2: AI-Powered Bug Triage Assistant](./project-2-bug-triage-assistant/)

## How to Use

These answers are provided as reference implementations to help you:
- Understand different approaches to solving the projects
- Learn best practices and patterns
- Compare your implementation with working solutions
- Get unstuck when facing challenges

**Important:** Try solving the projects yourself first! Use these answers as a learning resource, not a shortcut.

## Structure

Each project answer folder contains:
- `README.md` - Overview and explanation of the solution
- `src/` - Source code implementation
- `examples/` - Example inputs and outputs
- `tests/` - Test files
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## Learning Approach

1. **Read the project requirements** in the main project folder
2. **Attempt the implementation** yourself
3. **Compare with the answer** to see different approaches
4. **Learn from differences** and improve your solution
5. **Experiment** with enhancements and variations

## Notes

- These are reference implementations, not the only correct solutions
- Different approaches may be equally valid
- Focus on understanding the concepts, not copying code
- Feel free to improve upon these solutions!
